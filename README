Requirements:
* Ext 3.2 minimum.  We can upgrade to 3.3 if required (but not desired)

Background:
a) This is a workflow editor.  Each of the DataView nodes represent a workflow state.
b) Users can rearrange the nodes by clicking on the brown header in the DataView nodes and dragging and dropping the nodes into position.
c) The first and the last node are fixed and cannot be moved or dragged.
d) the "Add" button creates a new node in the DataView inserted before the "Add" button.  The "Add" button is not working in this version (and that's ok)
e) In the full version the label's are editable and are not working in this version (and that's ok)
f) The "close" icons are not working in this version (and that's ok)
This works in Firefox 3 and Chrome


Problems:
a) This code does not work on IE8.  The issues *seems* to occur on line 137 of index.html with the stateEditor.refresh() method call. - core task
b) The Proxy (Ext.agilebench.DuplicateProxy - but the same behaviour happens in StatusProxy) has strange positioning - bonus task
c) ideally the nodes would animate between positions - bonus task


Expected Solution:
a) This code should work without any errors in IE7, IE8 and IE9.
b) The proxy would appear in the exact same position as the draggable DataView node
c) As the nodes change position they would slide into position insead of being just appearing.
